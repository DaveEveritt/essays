# From the Personal to the Universal

> “Nothing being more important than anything else, a man of knowledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it matters to him. It’s controlled folly makes him say that what he does matters and makes him act as if it did, and yet he knows that it doesn’t; so when he fulfills his acts he retreats in peace, and whether his acts were good or bad, or worked or didn’t, is in no way part of his concern.” (‘Don Juan’ in “A Separate Reality” by Carlos Castaneda)

I will begin by stating a theme: The function of art in the finite world is to modify infinity, by modifying the creations of infinite energy. (matter is a modification of energy—therefore so is art). I assume acceptance of:

1. the existence of art, and
2. the existence of some infinite source-energy of omnipresent nature within and working through all visible and non-visible forms, keeping them in constant motion-existence.

Modifications of this energy can be classed beneath two headings:

1. modification by man.
2. modification by agents other than man.

(for if we do not consider ourselves separate, we invalidate the grounds for communication on two subject) We also separate man because we assume his creations to differ from those of other agents, because of the element of conscious mind. He is a thinking animal. He is also a thinking vegetable and mineral-in other words, a part of the modifications of nature which has taken on qualities of a land usually associated with the modifier-a mini-god, by virtue of no conscious powers of creation or choice as opposed to instinct or necessity. He therefore wields more scope as a modifier than does the rest of creation because, besides being a part of nature or ‘tool of the infinite’, he can also be aware of that fact, while consciously using the tools he has (body mind etc) to operate under direction from his own choice. He can, and this is where he is unique, use these tools to reflect his own identity, thereby reflecting the face behind his actions, the energy which gives him life. This faculty has sprung from the individuality of man which gives rise to self-consciousness; and the ability to perceive that consciousness through self-reflection, which other forms cannot do due to their lack of choice. To reach the state of super consciousness, which is a conscious integration of a man’s life with the force that sustains his life and consequently the force that sustains all other life, giving the realisation of an expanded individuality and unity with all things; to reach this state we have to grow from:

1. unconscious unity with all, such as we see in a plant or mineral, playing a part without wish to be anything else, and devoid of ‘I’ consciousness;
2. through the feeling of conscious separation from all, which gives rise to the desire for:
3. conscious unity with all, which the human unit then strives to attain.

At the stage where we are doubtful as to whether we are a part of, or distinct from nature, or both; we have the paradox: if man is a part of nature, what distinguishes human skill from natural, since art is defined in the dictionary as: quote{human skill as an agent as opposed to natural}. It seems that human skill is the action of human self-will, based upon observations centred upon the sense of ‘I’-ness, and that natural skill is the action of an indwelling yet superior will or intelligence operating via man and nature, and centred upon the sense of universality, co-operation and synthesis, as witnessed in all the universe; an ‘intelligent energy’.

Art appears to be an idiosyncrasy of human self-will or choice, and cannot exist outside it. To create art necessitates a separative tendency—to be apart from one’s surroundings, enabling the artist to achieve a particularly detached viewpoint. This state has been forcefully induced in the twentieth century because the surroundings have proved harsh and hostile in many cases. We could add that if surroundings became harmonious, art would dissolve into them, since no-one would notice it, since it would have to be integrated with the environment which would be pleasing enough not to encourage the desire to be apart from it to the degree of seeing separate units such as ‘art’, ‘science’ etc. without sensing the whole.

When life becomes art, one cannot create from selfish will because one is bound to produce that which the infinite wishes to create via oneself (or that would have to be the way of seeing the situation) and that creation would be of greatest benefit to the greatest practical number, as in all nature, when viewed as a whole. As a consequence, benefit to the group would be stressed, rather than the individual, as would group creation (we see the beginnings in ‘happenings’ and such groups as ‘fluxus’). Whether the group knew each other or not would become irrelevant (as is the case in contemporary art where many are now arriving at common means, independent from each other—yet they may still be considered as a ‘group’. Corot may not have known Constable, yet they both played major parts in the group of ‘landscape painters’). There would be no room for genius in such circumstances. Man as a group becomes ‘nature’ once more (as he does when considered as a ‘race’) because when we see it that way, he loses the individuality which separates him from nature, and so human skill ‘as opposed’ to natural skill becomes redundant.
